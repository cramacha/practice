Chapter 3: Stacks and Queues

1. Describe how you could use a single array to implement three stacks.

2. Design a stack which, in addition to push and pop, has a function min()
   which returns the minimum element.  All functions should operate in O(1)
   time.

3. Implement a structure SetOfStacks which starts
   a new stack when the limit of the most recent stack has reached a defined
   capacity.  The entire structure should still behave the way a normal stack
   would for push and pop methods.
   FOLLOW UP: Implement an API that will allow a caller to pop from a specified
   stack within the set, provided the index of the stack within the set.

4. Implement a queue by using two stacks.

5. Write a program to sort the elements in an unsorted stack.  The only other
   auxiliary data structure that you're allowed to use is another stack.

6. Design and implement an animal shelter which can hold dogs and cats.  The
   shelter has an adoption policy where you must adopt the animal that has
   been there the longest first.  A consumer should also have the option of
   adopting a certain type of animal (either a dog OR a cat).  In such a case,
   they should receive an animal of the specifed type which has been in the
   shelter the longest.
